# Reference content for the Altium Designer scripting system
This repository is an unofficial place where we gather the resource materials provided by Altium about the Scripting system of Altium Designer. It can be seen as a countermeasure against the badly organized / not really updated official documentation which is given by Altium.

Because some of the content available here is not publicly available any more from Altium, it may be way outdated so **use it with much care**.


## Documentation
Places where you may find the official documentation for the Scripting system:\
New documentation system (after 2018): https://www.altium.com/documentation/altium-dxp-developer/delphi-sdk-reference \
Old documentation system (before 2017): https://techdocs.altium.com/display/SCRT/Scripting

If you're looking for the good old documentation material in PDF format, you may have a chance to find ones from: http://valhalla.altium.com/Learning-Guides/ (needs advanced searching techniques).


## Script examples
At some point in the past, Altium provided a collection of example scripts for Altium Designer: https://techdocs.altium.com/display/SCRT/Script+Examples+Reference

But this is the notice you can read on the website as of March 2021:
> Due to progressive updates to the Altium Designer API, and therefore the scripting system Interfaces and their methods and properties, some legacy script examples may not work as originally intended. Nevertheless all of the scripts in the script examples collection are a useful resource, and can be used as reference information for creating your own scripts.

Fortunately we have decided to make all of those scripts available to the public through the present GitHub repository!\
If you prefer, you can download the package of old-fashioned scripts directly from the Altium's server (approximately written for Altium Designer 10): http://valhalla.altium.com/AD10-Examples/Examples/Scripts.zip
